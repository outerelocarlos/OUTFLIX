# Outflix

A front-end development showcase in the form of a responsive movie/TV website using a card-based design. Its data content comes from [The Movie Database's API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

The project follows as many good practices as possible to ensure a good browsing experience under any and all scenarios, benefit from SEO where possible and highlight my knowledge of the matters at hand.
